-custom hotkey(s) toggling AutoTaunt in protection spec
-custom add list for taunt mobs (in all specs) useful for encounters like heroic malkorok
-can you set up the add list for taunts? add name for malkorok heroic is "Living Corruption", as an example Living Corruption - NPC - World of Warcraft
-maximize shield block uptime over barrier when glyphed Heavy Repercussions to improve shield slam damages
-maximize enrage uptime with berserker rage when bloodthirst on cooldown and not enraged
-bladestorm only cancels when cleave threshold less than user set amount and/or not enraged with berserker rage on cool down (useable while storming)
-option to berserker rage for break fear, incapacitate, etc. useful for farming warbringers and heroic garrosh, terrace fears
-option to heroic leap in colossus smash, try maintain face target
-option for safeguard on cooldown as damage reduction like vigilance
-auto face target? This is minor but it's affected my dps when I paid less attention. Just for convenience
... There was one more major thing which I've totally forgotten. I'll post again when I remember. Keep up the good work, thanks.
