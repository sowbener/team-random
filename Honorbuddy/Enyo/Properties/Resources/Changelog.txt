Version 0.0.0.5-B1 & B2 & B3 & B4
====================================================
Due to this update some functionality will be gone - Based on the recent Warden updates and the uncertainty which causes the increased amount of bans, the Enyo team has decided to remove any direct LUA.

* Removed all LUA from Enyo.
* Removed ClickToMove functionality as it used LUA.
* Removed ChatOutputs and RaidWarnings from Enyo.
* Added Overlays as output in the WoWClient for pause functions.
* Added Enyo's own forced navigator - Prevents routines from moving even with movement enabled.
* Some code cleanup and rearrange.
